THE POTION GAME:
================

No longer requires Java 1.7 to run, should work down to java 1.6 now

This is a work in progress java game currently in pre-alpha stage.

To test this, run the executable jar in the zip download package

to add an ingrediant do add + [space] + ingrediant name

e.g. add wings

to bottle the potion do bottle

current ingredients:
wings

current recipes

{wings, wings} = potion of health 20

ommitting one of the wings wil reduce the potency of the potion however
at the current time, adding 3 wings is the same as adding 2 wings, i
haven't fully implemented over brewing yet
